# Polymarket Quant Analyst

**Polymarket Quant Analyst** is an advanced Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) research framework designed to assist analysts in estimating the probabilities of complex socio-economic and technical events using information markets as data sources. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and rigorous quantitative methodologies, it provides a structured approach to decision-making under uncertainty.

This repository (`polymarket-quant-analyst`) integrates principles from **probabilistic forecasting**, **market microstructure analysis**, and **forensic data auditing** to mitigate cognitive biases and identify systemic anomalies in decentralized consensus mechanisms.

## 🚀 Research Objectives

*   **Cognitive Bias Mitigation:** Utilizing recursive Delphi methods to reduce "hallucination echo chambers" in LLM-based event analysis.
*   **Microstructure Analysis:** Investigating how order book dynamics and data liquidity influence probability estimates.
*   **Forensic Audit:** analyzing resolution criteria and historical data patterns to identify edge cases in smart-contract-based markets.
*   **Mathematical Rigor:** Modeling probability distributions and data friction to determine the validity of a statistical forecast.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The core logic is encapsulated in `GEMINI.md`. This protocol guides the AI agent through a six-stage analytical pipeline:

1.  **Phase 0: Triage & Configuration** - Event classification and analytical profile selection.
2.  **Phase 1: Forensic Audit** - Examination of data sources, structural risks, and historical precedents.
3.  **Phase 2: Adversarial Simulation** - Multi-agent debate using base rate anchoring and external validation.
4.  **Phase 3: Quantitative Assessment** - Risk-adjusted probability estimation and modeling.
5.  **Phase 4: Microstructure Evaluation** - Evaluation of data depth, spread, and information flow imbalances.
6.  **Phase 5: The Watchtower** - Monitoring protocols for data invalidation and finalization windows.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Installation & Execution

This framework relies on **live web crawling** for real-time data verification. We recommend using the official **Gemini CLI**.

**Prerequisites:**
1.  **Install Gemini CLI**:
    *   **Windows Users:** We recommend installing [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) first. After installation, run `nvm install latest` to set up Node.js, then execute `npm install -g gemini-chat-cli`.
    *   **Official Guide:** [Gemini CLI Official Installation Guide](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).
2.  **Authentication:** You can either log in via your Google account using `gemini auth login` (recommended for [Google AI Pro](https://one.google.com/intl/zh-TW_tw/about/google-ai-plans/) users to access higher quotas) or set an API key.
3.  Ensure Search tools are enabled in your environment.

**Execution:**
1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chiakai-Chang/polymarket-quant-analyst.git
    cd polymarket-quant-analyst
    ```
2.  Start the **interactive research session**:
    ```bash
    gemini
    ```
3.  The system will automatically load the `GEMINI.md` protocol. Input a target market URL to begin analysis.
